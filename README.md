<b>Hey, I'm Kai Boos! ✌ </b>

<br>
I am practocing my language skills on a daily basis, overwhelmingly in privat projects.<br>
The most fun, active project I'm working on is a cocktailmachine programmed with Qt (C++) on a raspberry pi.<br>
<br>
I haven't published any Repositories as I am still working on improvement.<br>
Rest assured ... they're coming ✔
<br>

<b>Languages:</b> <br>
- C++
- Python
- SQL
- Java
