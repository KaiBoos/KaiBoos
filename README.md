<b>Hey, I'm Kai Schmidtner! âœŒ </b>

I work as an IT-/ERP-Administrator for a medium-sized food company and my job is to digitalize and optimize processes/activities. <br>
Therefore you can imagine that having some programming skills can come in handy ðŸ˜Ž<br>
<br>
Driven on improving my language skills, I practice and programm on a daily basis, overwhelmingly in privat projects.<br>
The most fun, active project I'm working on is a cocktailmachine programmed with Qt (C++) on a raspberry pi.<br>
<br>
I really like the challenge of not only creating something, but also breaking things down (like complex processes).<br>
<br>
<b>Languages:</b> <br>
- C++
- Python
- SQL
- Java
<br>



I haven't published any Repositories as I am still working on improvement.<br>
Rest assured ... they're coming âœ”
